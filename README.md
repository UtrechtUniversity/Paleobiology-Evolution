# Paleobiology-Evolution

Target audience: University students (BSc, MSc), interested laypeople, scientists from other fields

Discipline: Earth sciences, geoscience, evolutionary biology

## How to run

### Python

Practicals using Python have their individual `pyproject.toml` files which you can use to set up the environment for that given practical. I used `poetry`:

```shell
poetry shell
```

and from this virtual environment, run the code in a Python interpreter or IDE. 

### R

Use the `.Rproj` file in the folder of the practical or create a new one in R Studio.

## How to contribute 

If you would like to contribute to this OER, please see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

The instructions are written in [Quarto](https://quarto.org/), so edit the `.Rmd` files and render to your favorite format using `quarto render` or R Studio. For rendering files with Python code, R Studio might fail unless some extra magic is done, so command line is safer.

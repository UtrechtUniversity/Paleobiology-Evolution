## Welcome

This website contains computer practicals for the Paleobiology & Evolution course at Utrecht University.

## Available Practicals

### [Geometric Morphometrics](practicals/geometric_morphometrics.qmd)

### [Global Diversity](practicals/global_diversity_python.qmd) (Python) | [R version](practicals/global_diversity_r.qmd)
Explore patterns of biodiversity through time and space using computational approaches.
Available in both Python and R versions.

### [Phylogenetic Tree Reconstruction](practicals/phylogenetic_tree.qmd)
Build and analyze phylogenetic trees to understand evolutionary relationships.

### [Diversity Partitioning](practicals/diversity_partitioning.qmd)
Learn methods for partitioning biodiversity across different spatial scales.
